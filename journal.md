1.What did we do?

We learned about computational thinking, which consists of decomposition, Pattern recognition, Algorithm  design, and Abstraction. We then created a set of instructions for Dr. Ruben to follow in order to create a Jelly sandwhich. The instructions needed to precise and clear in order for us to finish the task.

2.What did you learn?

I learned how to use Github and learned about computational thinking.

3.What questions do I have?

How many different languages of coding are there?
