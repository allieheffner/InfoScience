# This is my journal for Info Science

1.What did we do?

We learned about computational thinking, which consists of decomposition, Pattern recognition, Algorithm  design, and Abstraction. We then created a set of instructions for Dr. Ruben to follow in order to create a Jelly sandwhich. The instructions needed to precise and clear in order for us to finish the task.

2.What did you learn?

I learned how to use Github and learned about computational thinking.

3.What questions do I have?

How many different languages of coding are there?

# Second Class 

1.What did we do?

We played around with Processing and learned how to make circles, squares, and combine colors. 

2.What did you learn?

I learned about how to make things as a random size and using random colors, which I thought was very cool.

3.What questions do I have?

How do I make a dice?
